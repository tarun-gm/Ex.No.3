# EXPERIMENT ‚Äì 3: Scenario-Based Report Development Using Diverse Prompting Approaches

### Register No.: 212223060284

### Date: 05.09.2025

---

## Aim:

To design an AI-powered customer service chatbot that can efficiently address **product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general queries** using **Straightforward Prompting, Tabular Format Prompting, and Preceding Question Prompting**.

---

## Tools Required:

* AI platforms (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude)
* Word/Excel (for organizing results)
* Internet connection
* Screenshots of chatbot conversations

---

## Theory:

Prompt engineering refers to designing instructions (prompts) in a structured way to make AI generate the desired output. Different prompt types influence how information is displayed:

| **Prompting Type**           | **Description**                                                      | **Best For**                        |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Straightforward Prompting    | Direct question or instruction to get a simple, precise answer.      | Quick facts, direct queries.        |
| Tabular Prompting            | AI is instructed to present output in table form.                    | Comparisons, troubleshooting steps. |
| Preceding Question Prompting | Builds conversation step by step, using previous answers as context. | Natural, human-like interactions.   |

---

## Experiment Procedure:

We tested **three scenarios** with all three prompting techniques.

### üìå Scenario 1: Product Troubleshooting

| **Prompt Type**              | **Example Prompt**                                               | **Generated Response** (Shortened)                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Straightforward Prompting    | ‚ÄúWhy is my smart vacuum cleaner not charging?‚Äù                   | *Check power supply ‚Üí Clean charging pins ‚Üí Replace battery.*           |
| Tabular Format Prompting     | ‚ÄúGive causes and solutions for vacuum not charging in a table.‚Äù  | (See table below)                                                       |
| Preceding Question Prompting | Q1: ‚ÄúMy vacuum isn‚Äôt charging.‚Äù <br> Q2: ‚ÄúIt shows a red light.‚Äù | *AI: Red blinking = Battery overheating. Suggest cooling before retry.* |

**Troubleshooting Table Output (from Tabular Prompting):**

| **Cause**                   | **Solution**              |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Power adapter faulty        | Test/replace adapter.     |
| Dust blocking charging port | Clean with dry cloth.     |
| Battery overheated          | Allow device to cool.     |
| Internal battery failure    | Replace with new battery. |

### üìå Scenario 2: Order Tracking

| **Prompt Type**              | **Example Prompt**                                        | **Generated Response**               |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Straightforward Prompting    | ‚ÄúTrack order #24567 placed on 1st September.‚Äù             | *Order shipped, arriving by Sept 7.* |
| Tabular Format Prompting     | ‚ÄúShow order #24567 delivery stages in table format.‚Äù      | (See table below)                    |
| Preceding Question Prompting | Q1: ‚ÄúTrack order #24567.‚Äù <br> Q2: ‚ÄúWhen will it arrive?‚Äù | *AI: Expected delivery Sept 7.*      |

**Order Tracking Table Output (from Tabular Prompting):**

| **Stage**        | **Status**         | **Date**    |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| Ordered          | Confirmed          | 01-Sep-2025 |
| Packed           | Ready for dispatch | 02-Sep-2025 |
| Shipped          | In Transit         | 03-Sep-2025 |
| Out for Delivery | Expected tomorrow  | 06-Sep-2025 |
